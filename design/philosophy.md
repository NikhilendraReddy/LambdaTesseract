# LambdaTesseract Philosophy

LambdaTesseract is a secure-first programming language designed to eliminate implicit trust in software systems.

Traditional programming languages treat security as an afterthought. LambdaTesseract embeds security directly into the execution model.

Core principles:

- Zero trust by default
- Functional flow-based execution
- Capability-based access control
- Immutable transformations
- Runtime verification of every execution unit

Priority order:

Security > Correctness > Clarity > Performance
