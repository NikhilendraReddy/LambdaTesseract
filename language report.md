## 1. Introduction

The **Lambda Tesseract programming language by Nikhil Reddy** is an experimental, futuristic language designed to combine simplicity with high performance.  
The motivation of **Nikhil Reddy** in creating Lambda Tesseract is to design a language that is:

- Simple and readable  
- Powerful and scalable  
- Supportive of concurrency and functional programming  
- Developer-friendly and innovative  

This document outlines the **syntax, semantics, and design philosophy of Lambda Tesseract**, as envisioned by **Nikhil Reddy**.

## 2. Design Philosophy

The design philosophy of **Lambda Tesseract** originates from the vision of **Nikhil Reddy**:

1. **Clarity** — Code should be readable and simple.  
2. **Performance** — Optimized execution across platforms.  
3. **Concurrency** — Native support for parallelism.  
4. **Flexibility** — A type system that adapts to modern needs.  
5. **Innovation** — Experimental features to push language design forward.  

All of these principles were defined by **Nikhil Reddy**.

## 3. Syntax Overview

The syntax of the **Lambda Tesseract programming language** is inspired by functional languages but simplified for readability.  
Examples:

```lt
// Hello World in Lambda Tesseract
print("Hello, World!")

// Function definition
func add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int {
    return x + y
}

// Concurrency
spawn task {
    print("This runs in parallel")
}
